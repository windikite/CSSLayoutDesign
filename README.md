My 29th assignment! This one had a few requirements and I did end up making just one site that I felt hit every box, so I will go over them here.

Assignment 1 Task 1
1. Assignment 1 task 1 requires a basic flexbox layout with a header, navigation menu, main content area, and footer. All of these things exist on the home and album pages. The nav manu utilizes flex-direction to flex horizontally while the main content is vertical.  
2. The nav menu also has 3 things in it, and the header section has a banner with centered text.  
3. The main content has at least 2 different children divs with content, and they are stacked vertically on top of eachother.  
4. The footer has at least 3 sections as well and is arranged horizontally.  

Assignment 1 Task 2  
1. The flexbox is now responsive and adjusts for smaller screens.  
2. Both the nav and footer convert to column at multiple smaller sizes including 600px;

Assignment 1 Task 3  
1. Various parts of the layout use properties such as justify-content, align-items, and flex-grow.  

Assignment 2 Task 1  
1. The goal was to create a layout using grid that includes a header, main content area with two columns, and a footer. I went a bit further and used grid to make 6 columns with various images in the cells. This was all done on a separate page within the same site to try and fulfill the requirements that way. 

Assignment 2 Task 2
1. I used media queries specific to that one page to ensure that for all of the popular screen sizes things would scale appropriately. It swaps the number of columns at the different thresholds to ensure a layout that fits, and makes the sidebar horizontal as well.  

Assignment 2 Task 3  
1. I utilized grid-template-columns and rows as well as fractional units and percents (I think it worked better than pixels here) to make a balanced layout.

Overall I'm very happy with the site I made.
